* shell-browser
This Zephyr module allows the usage of Zephyr shell
with just some buttons.
It does it by let you browse through the 
commands / arguments. The intension is to use it in the
prototyping pase as a simple user interface for boards which 
have a small screen and a small number of buttons. 

Instead of filter the shell input and output, which is what this
module does, implementing it as part of the shell would made it
more powerful.

** Build & Run
It is assumed that you have a working Zepyr environment with ZEPHYR_BASE set.
The code was tested with recent (3.2.99) head of Zephyr.
You can clone this repository as freestanding aplication
outside of the zephyr/zephyrproject tree.

: $ cd shell-browser
: $ west build app -t run
